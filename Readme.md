# SeeShark

> Simple C# camera library.

When you SeeShark, you C#!

Currently Work In Progress.

## State of the library

the `CameraStreamDecoder` class is now operational! Now a bunch of abstractions and encapsulation needs to be done for the library to be usable at all.

A few have been made, especially some `enum` types that are going to be used outside of the library.
A very subtle memory leak has been fixed and we ca now focus on abstractions again.
